# Educational Project "Sea"

Sea is my educational project that I implemented to hone my web development skills using Bootstrap and Gulp.

## About the Project

Sea is created for practicing and mastering the creation of responsive and stylish websites using Bootstrap and automating the build process with Gulp. This project allows me to experiment with various Bootstrap components, optimize the project structure, and acquire skills in using Gulp to improve productivity and development efficiency.

## Features

- **Bootstrap Integration**: Utilize Bootstrap components to create responsive layouts and UI elements.
- **Sass Preprocessor**: Apply the Sass preprocessor for more convenient and maintainable styling, with subsequent compilation and autoprefixing using Gulp.
- **Gulp Tasks**: Automate routine build tasks such as Sass compilation, CSS and JavaScript minification, image optimization, and more.
- **Development Server**: Employ BrowserSync for live reloading and synchronized browser testing during development.
- **Customization**: Extend and configure Gulp tasks according to specific project requirements.
